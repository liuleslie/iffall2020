			<strong>hi again,</strong> this is Leslie! (Leslie Liu.) I'm a junior in Communication Design minoring in HCI.</li>
		<li>
			<h3>[some background info]</h3>
		<p>i've taken some object oriented programming classes throughout high school (python, java) and this summer got into creative coding with p5.js. i love interface design/critique and I feel this class will help me better build things from scratch (as well as get to know my machine better).</p>
		<p>i'm interested in further exploring our (human) relationship with tech/AI, the physicality of the web (& our interfaces), and immersive realities, among other things.</p>
		</li>
		<em>(here's something I made in July: a window for you and your computer to watch digital sunsets together.)</em>

			<h3>[experience with HTML/CSS/JS]</h3><p>I haven't used HTML/CSS/JS in an involved way for a while (since middle school really) but as I continue working with p5 I'm getting reacquainted with JS. I did use some very, <em>very</em> crude HTML for <a href="https://liuleslie.github.io/interactwith/">some experiments in AFrame</a>. (acts up in Chrome, might need a different browser)</p><br></li>
		<li>
			<h3>[one thing to graduate with]</h3><p>a more thorough undersanding of web structures/architecture and ways to make my own tools as needed. (i want	to build light, accessible, magical fun and weird websites that make people smile.)</p><br>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>[how designing for the screen != on paper]</h3>
			<p>the logic behind web design definitely requires a more concrete understanding of hierarchy and organization—I anticipate a more systematic, math-guided approach. (digital space itself is also more dematerialized/fluid; I suppose it'd require a different kind of spatial awareness/reasoning/imagination.)</p><br>
		</li>

			<h3><a href="http://photorequestsfromsolitary.org/">[effective design—] photo requests from solitary.</a></h3>
			<p>The modular grid sets up a dependable logic. Simple geometric shapes hint at a legend/key. Text is clear and easy to read. Scaled and responsive: adapts as window is resized. Animations aren't too heavy or over the top, which highlight the content housed here. The circle on the About page acts as a reliable marker of the visitor's current location. Text is typeset at consistent point sizes, with clear divisions when sections end and begin. Hover states also communicate extra info contained in hyperlinks. (A nice touch also as underlined text: shows an attention to affordances)</p><br>
		</li>

			<h3><a href="http://zz-is.it/">[effective communication—] Zipeng Zhu's website!</a></h3>
			<p>Zhu's website neatly follows his visual/design language. Bold, all caps text is friendly and the nav at the four corners encourages the visitor to wander around. Hover states are dazzling, explosive, and vibrant. The color scheme is also upbeat and outgoing—broad strips/highlights to the left and right also suggest a primarily horizontal browsing experience.</p><br>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3><a href="https://jessicasvendsen.com/">Jessica Svendsen's website</a> is elegantly designed and works very well, but I mean, <a href="http://bestofsicily.com/">Best of Sicily</a> works well enough.</h3>
			<p>Svendsen's site presents a narrative that flows from past to present in a smooth fashion: centered text blocks allow for a focused reading experience. The underlying grid serves this site's purpose well as it details Svendsen's experience in a straightforward manner. Colors, while understated, are comfortable and the different fonts are chosen with intention and care.</p>
