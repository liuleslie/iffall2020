					Chains stretch the great lake around you <br>
					Pull you along by the knots in your hair <br>
					It's just like you'd never been there <br>

			<section class="verse">
				<h5>verse</h5>
				<p>
					Cold tooth and ice scattered islands <br>
					Faithfully facing the warmth of the sun <br>
					All to the quickening dawn <br>
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="chorus">
				<h5>chorus</h5>
				<p>
					Fever on the thorough-way brow <br>
					The sober scent of paper <br>
					Teething cries in what the rain hides <br>
					Were not enough to save you <br>
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="verse">
				<h5>verse</h5>
				<p>
					Faith is a race from the silence <br>
					Widens and swallows you <br>
					Head first and whole <br>
					Fight through the whitening bones <br>
				</p>
			</section>


			<section class="bridge">
				<h5>bridge</h5>
				<p>
					Secede while you can while you're able <br>
					Sorrow may tap at the root of your song <br>
					Light sparks the opening bomb <br>
				</p>

					Every ache is dissolved in the brine <br>
					And the waves from the bay and then rise <br>
					But the shark ridden garden will run dry again <br>
